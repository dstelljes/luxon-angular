# Contributing

Any contributions to this project are welcome! Before you open an issue or create a pull request, though, note that this project isn’t a general-purpose date library. If a feature isn’t supported by Luxon, it probably won’t be supported here.

## Building and testing

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:dstelljes/luxon-angular.git
$ cd luxon-angular
$ npm install
```

Run tests:

```
$ npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```
$ npm run test:watch
```

Build:

```
$ npm run build
```

## Pull requests

1.   Discuss your proposed change (via issue, email, Twitter, whatever) before you sink time into implementing it.

2.   Ensure all changes are relevant to the pull request. If you have a bunch of changes, it’s better to open a few small pull requests than a single massive one.

3.   Add/modify tests as necessary. Tests should pass and the build should succeed.

4.   Make sure that any large or notable changes are documented in the changelog (and the readme if appropriate).

5.   Open all pull requests against the development branch.
